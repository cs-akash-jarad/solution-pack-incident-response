# solution-pack-incident-response
The FortiSOAR™ Incident Response Solution Pack (solution-pack-incident-response) enables users to experience the power of FortiSOAR™ incident response. FortiSOAR™ is built using modular architecture and the solution pack is the implementation of best practices to configure and use FortiSOAR™ in an optimal manner. The solution pack also contains a lot of sample/simulation/training data that enables you to experience FortiSOAR™ without having all the devices.

## Deploying IR Solution Pack

**Important**: Before you deploy the solution pack, ensure that you have installed FortiSOAR™ and there are no records such as alerts, indicators, incidents, etc., in your FortiSOAR™ system.

The steps for deploying a solution pack are mentioned in the [Deploying a Solution Pack](https://github.com/fortinet-fortisoar/how-tos/blob/main/DeployingASolutionPack.md) article.
